# GVE DevNet ACI EPGs Contracts Export
This prototype utilizes the ACI REST API to get all EPGs and contract relations configured in APIC. The Python script generates the following:

An overview csv file which provides a summary of how many application EPGs and contracts relations are there in each tenant. Then thereâ€™s a csv file for each tenant that shows the application profiles, EPGs and contracts(type and state). An empty tenant file indicates a tenant with no application profiles and EPGs.
